        <h1>happy bday from Ethan to Venice!!!</h1>
        <p>idk how to give u the best greeting and decided to build a website for u lol</p>
        <button id="surpriseBtn">Click hereee *</button>
        <div id="surpriseMessage" class="hidden">
            <p>I like how u...</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-enjoy reading altho they might be spicyyy😭 Wish u have more books and also hope ur parents don't find them out lmao</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-are so caring for others, being sensitive can be hard for u but it made u so beautiful. u are always so nice it makes me feel good🥹</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-don't get annoyed by me. When u said u check messages to see me and think it's weird, it's not, I want u like that 🫶</p>
            <p>I like how we...</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-talk to each other everyday, it's something we gotta do at this point. I can be alone only if I'm alone with u if that makes sense 🤧</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">-never distance each other despite the distance. 🤧 We share our worries without hiding them and comfort each other</p>
            <p>I like u...</p>
            <p>Anyways... wish u the happiest birthday, I hope u like this gift u encouraged me to build my first website it's all because of you, the website is barely functional though... Sorry I'm still learning these stuff. I hope next time I can see u in real life for ur bday, or mine, or anytime </p>
